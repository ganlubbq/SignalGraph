This is a tutorial for mask prediction.
The mask is predicted by neural networks and used for beamforming filter estimation. 

Step 1. Run addMyPath.m in the SignalGraph root directory to add all library m files into the path of Matlab. 
Step 2. Run TrainMaskBF_MaskSubnet_CHiME4.m in the recipe folder SignalGraph/examples/beamforming/mask_prediction. Remember to set the data path of CHiME-4 in the file.
