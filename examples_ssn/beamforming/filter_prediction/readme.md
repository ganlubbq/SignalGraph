Filter prediction is one types of learning based beamforming. It refers to the case of using neural networks to predict beamforming filter parameters, either in time or frequency domains. 

This tutorial will present the recipe of predicting frequency domain beamforming filter prediction. The input will be generalized cross corrleation (GCC) features, and the network type will be either deep neural networks (DNN) or long short term memory (LSTM) networks.
